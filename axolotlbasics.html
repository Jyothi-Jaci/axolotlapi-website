                                        Axolotls are cute but critically endangered creatures. This page will educate you about the basics of axolotl care. It will cover important subjects such as needed materials, cycling, fungus treatment, food, and survival.<br>

                                        Axolotls are carnivores, meaning that they only eat meat.

                                        <br><br>

                                        <h6>What should axolotls eat</h6><hr>

                                        <b>Worms contain all the nutrients for your axolotl, but not all worms (e.g. blood worms) are nutritious and should only be considered as a treat.</b>

                                        <br><br>

                                        For axolotl babies, you should start with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Nutrition-Food-Instant-Brine/dp/B00176GU32" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">baby brine shrimp</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/200-Live-Daphnia-Aqua-Lamour/dp/B083RP1LW4" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">daphnea</a> and then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tetra-Blood-Freeze-0-28-Ounce-100-Ml/dp/B0002563LS" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">blood worms</a> as much as they want to eat.

                                        <br><br>

                                        Once they're around 2 months old you want to begin giving them <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yorkshire-Worms-LARGE-Dendrobaena-Pack/dp/B07PBX3LVX" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">dendrobaena worms</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/African-Nightcrawlers-LB-Live-Worms/dp/B073XPNGPF" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">night crawlers</a> twice a day. Chop them into pieces as small as the distance between your axolotl's eyes, as they will be way too for your axolotl otherwise.

                                        <br><br>

                                        You can feed adult axolotls every other day (3 or 4 times per week) with <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yorkshire-Worms-LARGE-Dendrobaena-Pack/dp/B07PBX3LVX" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">dendrobaena worms</a>.<br><br>

                                        There's also the dry food option, for example <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0112XPAB2" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">Hikari Sinking Carnivore Pellets</a>. You can also try <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X4S6M0M" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">Grub pie by Repashy</a>, although it may stink when you make it.

                                        <br><br>

                                        <h6>Axolotl treats</h6><hr>

                                        For treats you can give your axolotl <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tetra-Blood-Freeze-0-28-Ounce-100-Ml/dp/B0002563LS" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">blood worms</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tetra-RiverShrimp-Dried-Freshwater-Saltwater/dp/B004HSUKQA" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">river shrimp</a> (ghost or cherry shrimp) or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Foods-Freshwater-Seasoning-Flavoring-Condiments/dp/B08JGJZ2NM" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">fresh water prawns</a>. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chicken-Sea-Premium-Skinless-Boneless/dp/B003RWVFEI" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">Salmon</a> is also a good treat, but be careful, they must have no salt added and not be smoked. On top of that you should also always freeze the salmon for at least 30 days to kill bacteria, then simply place a frozen piece in a cup with some tank water and let it defrost before giving it to your axolotl, same applies to frozen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tetra-Blood-Freeze-0-28-Ounce-100-Ml/dp/B0002563LS" rel="nofollow" class="default-a">blood worms</a>.

                                        <br><br>

                                        <h6>What not to give</h6><hr>

                                        Any mammalian meat, poultry or meal worms, they can barely digest it or not at all.<br>
                                        In the end there is a lot of safe options available and as usual. If you have any doubt about something just don't feed, better be safe than sorry.<br>

                                        <br><br>

                                        For axolotl babies, you should start with baby brine shrimp, daphnea and then blood worms as much as they want to eat.

                                        <br><br>

                                        Once they're around 2 months old you want to begin giving them dendrobaena worms or night crawlers twice a day. Chop them into pieces as small as the distance between your axolotl's eyes, as they will be way too for your axolotl otherwise.

                                        <br><br>

                                        You can feed adult axolotls every other day (3 or 4 times per week) with dendrobaena worms.<br><br>

                                        For treats you can give your axolotl blood worms, river shrimp (ghost or cherry shrimp) or fresh water prawns. Salmon is also a good treat, but be careful. Salmons as treats must have no salt added and not be smoked. On top of that you should also always freeze the salmon for at least 30 days to kill bacteria, then simply place a frozen piece in a cup with some tank water and let it defrost before giving it to your axolotl, same applies to frozen blood worms.
